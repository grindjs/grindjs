# Grind Documentation
This is the main documentation for Grind and powers [grind.rocks/docs](https://grind.rocks/docs)

Good documentation is key for any framework and contributions are encouraged!  The docs are built in markdown so you should be able to easily fork and edit.

If you’d prefer to edit locally an view them as you work, you can setup the [Grind site](https://github.com/grindjs/site):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/grindjs/site.git grind-site
cd grind-site/resources
git clone https://github.com/grindjs/docs.git && cd ..
yarn install
bin/cli watch
```

Once running, navigate to [localhost:3900/docs](http://localhost:3900/docs).
